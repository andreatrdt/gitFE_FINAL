*Multivariate Pricing for Financial Derivatives*
This repository contains the Final Project for the Financial Engineering course AY 2023-2024. In this project, we develop and calibrate multivariate models based on Lévy processes for pricing structured derivatives on equity indices, specifically targeting the S&P 500 and EURO STOXX 50 markets.

*Overview*
The project focuses on:

Modeling Forward Prices: We assume that the forward price for asset i at time t is given by F_i(t, T) = F_i(0, T) * exp(X_i(t) + p_i * t) where X_i(t) = Y_i(t) + a_i * Z(t) is a multivariate Lévy process with Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) marginals.

Martingality and Drift Compensation: We derive the drift compensators p_i so that the forward price processes are martingales.

Calibration of the Multivariate Lévy Model: The project calibrates the marginal parameters (kappa, theta, sigma) jointly for both markets under the constraint (sigma_1^2) / (theta_1^2 * kappa_1) = (sigma_2^2) / (theta_2^2 * kappa_2) = c and further calibrates the dependence parameters to match the market-implied correlation with historical data.

Synthetic Forwards and Discount Factors: We compute discount factors and forward prices using synthetic forward techniques (via Put/Call parity) as an alternative to classical bootstrap methods.

Comparison with the Black Model: In order to assess model performance, we also calibrate a plain Black model and compare its forward exponents, volatility surfaces, and pricing accuracy to those of the Lévy model.

Exotic Derivative Pricing: Finally, we price a derivative with a payoff defined as: (S_1(t) - S_1(0))^+ * 1_{S_2(t) < 0.95 * S_2(0)} and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each modeling approach.

*Requirements*
MATLAB (R2021a or later recommended)
MATLAB Toolboxes: Optimization Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox (for FFT calibration)
Optionally, parts of the project have been implemented in Python (see docs/ folder for additional scripts and instructions)


*How to Run*
Data Preparation: Place the market data files (e.g., OptionData.mat, SPXSX5Ereturns.mat) in the "data/" folder.

Calibration: Run the main calibration script (e.g., multivariateCalibration.m in the "src/" folder). This script will:

Load market option data.
Compute synthetic discount factors and forward prices.
Jointly calibrate the marginal parameters of the NIG processes.
Calibrate the dependence parameters by matching the model correlation with historical returns.
Pricing: After calibration, run the pricing scripts to compute:

European option prices using the calibrated Lévy model (via the Lewis formula and FFT).
Prices under the Black model for comparison.
Prices for the exotic derivative with the specified payoff.
Analysis: Review the output plots and error measures generated by the scripts. Detailed analysis is provided in the project report.

*Results and Discussion*
The calibrated multivariate Lévy model captures the time-variation of volatility across multiple maturities and market characteristics (e.g., equity skew, fat tails) better than the Black model.
The synthetic forwards approach provides an alternative method to bootstrap discount factors from market option data.
A key challenge was ensuring consistency in calibration across both markets, given the interdependencies imposed by the model constraints.
Price differences between the models highlight trade-offs: while the Lévy model is more descriptive in volatile, skewed markets, the Black model remains computationally efficient for rapid pricing.
